# Brand Logos

Place your brand logo files in this folder with the following exact filenames:

## Required Files:

1. **brother.png** - Brother logo (recommended: 200x80px, transparent PNG)
2. **pegasus.png** - Pegasus logo (recommended: 200x80px, transparent PNG)  
3. **yamato.png** - Yamato logo (recommended: 200x80px, transparent PNG)
4. **supreme.png** - Supreme logo (recommended: 200x80px, transparent PNG)

## Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Approximately 200px width (height can vary, will be contained)
- **Style**: Horizontal/landscape orientation preferred
- **Color**: Full color or monochrome versions acceptable

## How it works:
The website will automatically:
1. Try to display the image file (e.g., `brother.png`)
2. If the image doesn't exist or fails to load, it will show the brand name in text as a fallback

## To add your logos:
1. Save each brand logo as a PNG file with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this `images/brands/` folder
3. Refresh your website - the logos will appear immediately

## Need help?
If you don't have the logo files yet, the website will display the brand names (BROTHER, PEGASUS, YAMATO, SUPREME) in professional text format until you add the actual image files.
